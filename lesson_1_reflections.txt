How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?
It's much easier to find a bug when you don't have to do it at all. Especially
in big files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?
Having previous versions of code is really helpful. It gives you perspective
to go back in time.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
Docs does?
Manual commits are better because they give us an ability to chose commit sizes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Some files have dependable code in it, so we have to change all of them at once.
That's why we have to track any changes together.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Log shows you changes in files and commits ids. diff shows you changes between
commits by passing ids to it.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
Because I can always go back, I can have no worries about any changes.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I want to write code. That's it.
